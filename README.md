## Overview

**PlantVIT-C** is a complete, from-scratch implementation of **PlantVIT**, a lightweight Vision Transformer specifically designed for tomato disease classification, in pure C. This project is tailored for agricultural IoT devices, embedded systems, and smart farming environments where real-time plant disease diagnosis is crucial. It demonstrates how complex transformer architectures can be implemented without external dependencies, making it ideal for deployment on resource-constrained agricultural devices.

This implementation can classify 9 different tomato disease states using a much lighter and more efficient architecture compared to standard ViT models. Every component, from basic linear algebra operations to multi-head self-attention mechanisms, has been implemented from the ground up using only standard C libraries.

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **C Compiler:** `gcc` or `clang` with C99/C11 support
- **Build System:** `make` utility
- **Python Environment:** `python3` with the following packages:
  ```bash
  pip install torch torchvision einops numpy
  ```

### Step 1: Generate Weights

Extract PlantVIT model weights and convert them to binary format:

```bash
python3 utils/export_weights.py
```

This will create the PlantVIT model structure and (if available, load from `plantvit_tomato.pth`) create a `vit_weights.bin` file containing all model parameters in the exact order expected by the C implementation.

### Step 2: Compile the Project

Build the C project using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make all
```

This compiles all source files with optimization flags (`-O2`) and creates the `vit_inference` executable.

### Step 3: Run the Inference Demo

Execute the compiled program:

```bash
./vit_inference
```

**Expected Output:**

```

## Architecture Overview

The PlantVIT-C implementation follows a lightweight Vision Transformer architecture:

1. **Patch Embedding:** Divides input images (256√ó256√ó3) into 32√ó32 patches, creating 64 patch tokens
   - **Special Structure:** LayerNorm ‚Üí Linear ‚Üí LayerNorm (different from standard ViT)
2. **Position Embedding:** Adds learnable positional encodings to patch embeddings
3. **Transformer Encoder:** 3 identical blocks, each containing:
   - **Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA):** 3 attention heads with 32-dimensional head space
   - **Layer Normalization:** Applied before each sub-layer (Pre-LN architecture)
   - **MLP Block:** Feed-forward network with GELU activation (32‚Üí16‚Üí32)
   - **Residual Connections:** Skip connections around each sub-layer
4. **Classification Head:** Final layer normalization + linear projection to 9 classes (tomato diseases)
